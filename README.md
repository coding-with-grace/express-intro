# Express Intro

Express is a Node.js framework for request handling. It is built on top of Node's http module. 

## Notes
- After requiring Express, create application instance (app), which has many methods available to configure
our application and define its behavior (i.e. how it responds to requests)
- RESTful routing: Express provides a Router() middleware to create modular, mountable route handlers
- Install and use `nodemon`, a CLI utility for automatically restarting Node.js applications every time changes are made
